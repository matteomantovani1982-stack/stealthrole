"""
app/services/llm/profile_prompt.py

Profile-aware prompt builders.

These replace (and extend) the CV-only prompts in prompts.py.
The key difference: Claude now receives the full candidate knowledge layer —
the structured intake answers, hidden context, and per-application overrides —
not just what's on the CV.

Two output schemas:
  1. EditPlan          — how to rewrite the CV (unchanged from prompts.py)
  2. PositioningStrategy — the "how to win this role" output (NEW)

The PositioningStrategy is the product's core differentiator:
  - Your 3 strongest angles for this specific role, in plain language
  - Gaps to acknowledge and how to handle them
  - The narrative thread to run through everything
  - Red flags the interviewer will raise and how to address them
  - Your positioning headline (one sentence)

Your job is to analyse a candidate's FULL professional story (not just their CV) against a specific job description and produce a precise, actionable Positioning Strategy.

This is not generic career advice. It is a tactical brief telling the candidate exactly:
- Which of their strengths to lead with for THIS role
- How to frame their experience to address THIS company's needs
- What gaps exist and precisely how to handle them
- What the interviewer will worry about and how to pre-empt it

Rules:
- Be specific, not generic. "You have strong leadership skills" is useless. "Lead with the Baly zero-to-scale story because e& is explicitly hiring for someone who has run operating model redesign at pace" is useful.
- Reference the candidate's actual experiences by name.
- Reference the JD's actual language and requirements.
- Never invent experience the candidate doesn't have.
- If a gap is serious, say so honestly — and give a real mitigation strategy, not false reassurance.
- The strongest_angles list should have exactly 3 entries, ordered by impact.

2. A CV STRUCTURE — the actual paragraphs in their CV file, with indices. You edit THESE paragraphs.
3. A JOB DESCRIPTION — the target role.

Your job: produce an EditPlan that rewrites the CV content to maximally match this specific JD, using the richest possible information from the candidate profile.

Rules:
- Draw on the full candidate profile, not just what's already written in the CV
- Only include information that is TRUE (from the profile or CV) — never invent
