app/services/llm/client.py

Claude API client for CareerOS.

Responsibilities:
- Single entry point for all Claude API calls
- Structured JSON output enforcement (prompt + parse)
- Retry with exponential backoff on rate limits / transient errors
- Token usage tracking (stored in JobStep.metadata_json)
- Cost estimation per call

Design constraints:
- Synchronous — runs inside Celery workers (no event loop)
- Never imports FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, or Celery
- Raises typed exceptions so task layer can decide retry vs fail

Two call modes:
  1. call_structured() — expects JSON response, parses and validates
  2. call_text()        — returns raw text (for future use / debugging)
